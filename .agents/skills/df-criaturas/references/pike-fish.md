*A medium-sized, green fish found in temperate lakes.*

**Pike** are a species of fish who can be found at temperate rivers and lakes. They are roughly half the size of a dwarf, and provide a fair amount of returns when butchered. As non-vermin fish, pike can't be fished by fisherdwarves, but can be caught with the use of a drowning chamber. Infant pike are called *pike fry*.

Some dwarves like pike for their *distinct markings*.

Admired for its *distinct markings*.

Also, do not attempt to arm your army with these, as they have low penetration and are very prone to bending.
