**Ogres** are huge (a fully grown ogre is 100 times the size of an average dwarf, however most ogres you encounter will not be fully grown), violent humanoids found in evil plains. They are highly aggressive, able to destroy buildings and strong enough to make short work of war dogs and inexperienced dwarves. Ogres usually appear in groups of 1-3, which can prove a deadly threat to a new fortress. An attack by ogres in the very beginning will make short work of most unprepared embarkation attempts.

Goblins may bring ogres in sieges in place of trolls [\[1\]](/index.php/DF2014_Talk:Ogre "DF2014 Talk:Ogre"), and, like trolls, they are fully capable of swimming (not unlike their blind cave cousins). It is interesting to note that a clothed ogre is a lot tougher than a troll; if it is wearing good enough armor, it can possibly shrug off masterfully wielded, masterwork steel battle axe strikes.

Some dwarves like ogres for their *low howls*.

Ogres do, in fact, have layers, but as yet, have not been observed travelling with donkeys.

## Trivia

- Previously, the sprites of ogres were less threatening and malformed-looking:
